<h1>GrapthQL API Inventory</h1>
<h2>Brief:</h2>
<p> This is a NodeJs API that uses GraphQL to query a Postgresql database. This API and database willbe hosted on Heroku using their free tier for now, later we will migate the DB and put it on the tier </p>

<h3>API:</h3>
<p>This API will be fairly simple at the start. It will be used at the middle tier for a React Native mobile application, this app will be cross platform and in a future scope become a hybrid app running on both mobile and web platforms.

Heroku will be the host for the API, this will allow rapid growth, free hosting and be able to read from a fast speed.

This will be queried using GraphQl for fast simple data gathering, allow fast API dev with minimal entry points making developement simpler. </p>
